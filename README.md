## Project Title: Data Analysis Process
___

### Project Overview
This project aims to summarise the steps of the data analysis process. The goal of data analysis is to discover useful information, inform conclusions, and support decision-making. In this project, I will be using data sourced from my LITA Data Analysis class to explain the data analysis steps which include: data sourcing, tools for data analysis, data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, data analysis, and data visualisation. 

### Data Sources 
The primary source of data used here is International Breweries.csv and this is an opne source data that can be freely downloaded from an open soruce such as kaggle, FRED, or any other data repository site. [Download Here](https://www.kaggle.com/)

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualisation
 
- SQL- Structured Query Language for querying data
- GIThub for portfolio building

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
This involves checking the data for errors and inconsistencies, and correcting or removing them. In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparations we performed the following actions:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This involves exploration of the data to answer some questions about the data:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis 
This involves applying statistical or mathematical techniques to the data to discover patterns, relationships, or trends. This includes some basic lines of codes or queries or even some DAX functions used in analysis.

```SQL
SELECT * from InternationalBreweries
where brand = 'trophy'
```

### Data Visualisation ðŸ’»

You can also insert tables manually
